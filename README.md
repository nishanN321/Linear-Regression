# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project predicts diamond prices based on their features using a Linear Regression model trained on the classic **diamonds** dataset. The dataset includes attributes like carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and table, which significantly impact the price.
